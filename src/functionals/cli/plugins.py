"""
Dynamically discovers and loads plugin modules from a Python package.

When a plugin module is imported, any ``@registry.register(...)`` calls
at module level execute automatically — no manual wiring in ``main.py``
is needed.

Usage::

    from functionals.cli import load_plugins
    from app.commands import user_commands  # treated as a package

    load_plugins("app.commands", registry)

Convention:
    Any ``.py`` file inside the given package is treated as a plugin.
    Files starting with ``_`` (including ``__init__``) are skipped.
